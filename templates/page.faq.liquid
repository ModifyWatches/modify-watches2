      <h5> + What are the watches made of and how big are they?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p><b>Metal Watch</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stainless steel back, gun metal case</li>
          <li>Durable and comfortable dense woven nylon or whole grain leather bands</li>
          <li>5ATM Water-Resistant (Go swimming!)</li>
          <li>Japanese Quartz Movement</li>
          <li>Watch Face (LxW): 38mm x 38mm</li>
          <li>Watch Band (LxW): 9in x 20mm</li>
        </ul>     
        <p><b>Sport Watch</b></p>   
        <ul>
          <li>Stainless steel, scratch-resistant polycarbonate</li>
          <li>Super-soft, lightweight, and durable UV-coated silicone straps</li>
          <li>3ATM Water-Resistant</li>
          <li>Japanese Quartz Movement</li>

          <li>Watch Band (LxW): 8.7in x 22mm</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h5> + Are these water-resistant?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p>Our metal watches are 5ATM water-resistant, meaning they're suitable for swimming, but not diving. Our silicone sport watches are 3ATM water-resistant which means they are splash proof, and are fine in the rain or while doing the dishes, but we don't recommend swimming or surfing with them on.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h5> + Where do I get a replacement battery?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p>We've always been annoyed having to find batteries when our watch stops ticking. So we decided to help you out and send you the correct one. Of course, you shouldn't need to switch batteries for a while, but if you do just e-mail help@modifywatches.com and we'll send one sealed with a loving kiss. If you're desperate for a new battery within 6 minutes, Sony number 364/SR621SW will work great!</p>
      </div>
      
      <h5> + Can I change the battery myself?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p>Yes! All you need is a battery (Sony number 364/SR621SW - we’ll send to you if you need it!), and a small screwdriver—like the one you can find in an eyeglass repair kit sold at most drug and grocery stores. Just unscrew the screws on the back, remove the metal cover, gently pull up the plastic cover, and replace the battery!</p>
      </div>
      
      <h5> + What if I want to return or exchange my order?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p>Not a problem! E-mail us (<a href="mailto:help@modifywatches.com">help@modifywatches.com</a>) and let us know you’d like to return or exchange your order, provide your order number, and why (we’re always looking for ways to improve, and really appreciate your feedback!)</p>
      </div>
      
      <h5> + What does our 1 year warranty cover?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p>Great question: The 1 year warranty covers defective watches from the date of shipment. Should the watch stop working properly, we will send you a new one. Contact us if the battery stops, we've stocked extras so you don't have to go on a pesky battery hunt! Watches are not considered defective if you cause physical harm to it. Basically, if the watch stops working on its own, we got your back. Simply send us an email to <a href="mailto:help@modifywatches.com">help@modifywatches.com</a> and we will gladly walk you through the process.</p>
        <p>We'd love to help you out even if it's past the date, so don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>

      <h5> + What is the licensing agreement?</h5>
      <div>
        <hr class="orangeDash">
        <p>
          Since 2010 Modify has worked with some of the biggest brands in the world. Your brand should be treated with the same respect as the NBAs or the Foo Fighters or Nike's.
        </p>
        <p>
          The licensing agreement is a short document, which protects both of us. While you need to read all the details, the biggest points (in our opinion) are that:
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>We will not use your brand in a way that you don't want us to. I.e. we'll get your permission for designs, and we'll respect your trademarks as if they were our property.</li>
              <li>You promise that you have the rights to your logo!</li> 
              <li>Everything else is mutual (i.e. your team and ours are treated like equals). Basically, we want to build a great, long-term partnership with you.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As we're launching hundreds of partners, we worked hard to make this as beneficial of an agreement for both sides.
